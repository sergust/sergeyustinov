              Hello, my name is Sergei Ustinov and I have a passion for building
              incredible things for the internet. My journey as a programmer
              began when I was just 7 years old, when my father brought me a PC
              from overseas. From a young age, I have been practicing building
              websites instead of playing video games. I am a proactive and
              detail-oriented problem solver, with a track record of delivering
              successful projects on time and within budget.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently focused on building an IoT platform for farmers at
              Sensand, a B2B SaaS platform that serves agriculture and land use
              managers as end users, with the entire AgTech ecosystem of tech
              providers working in one environment. As a software engineer with
              over 2 years of experience in developing and maintaining software
              applications, I have a strong foundation in front-end development
              using Angular, Vue, React, and TypeScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest
              developments in the software industry and exploring new
              technologies. I am based in Sydney, Australia and am always open
              to new opportunities to join a dynamic and innovative company
              where I can make a positive impact on software development
              efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Here are technologies that I am most experienced with:</p>
